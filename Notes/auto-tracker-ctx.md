The **auto-tracker context** is a region of memory where a portion of the randomizer's configuration variables are stored in a versioned layout defined below. Its intent is to give some symbols added by the randomizer well-defined addresses so that auto-trackers can read them reliably without needing the symbols.json for the specific randomizer version that was used to generate the seed.

The starting address of the auto-tracker context is listed at address `0x8040_000c` (randomizer context + `0xc`). On versions of the randomizer before this feature was added, the starting address is given as zero. At that address, the following data can be found:
